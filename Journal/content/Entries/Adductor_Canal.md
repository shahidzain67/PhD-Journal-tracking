The adductor canal (Hunter’s canal, subsartorial canal) is a narrow conical tunnel located in the thigh.

It is approximately 15cm long, extending from the apex of the femoral triangle to the adductor hiatus of the adductor magnus. The canal serves as a passageway from structures moving between the anterior thigh and posterior leg.

The adductor canal is bordered by muscular structures:

- Anteromedial: Sartorius.

- Lateral: Vastus medialis.

- Posterior: Adductor longus and adductor magnus.

The adductor canal runs from the apex of the femoral triangle to the adductor hiatus – a gap between the adductor and hamstring attachments of the adductor magnus muscle.

The adductor canal serves as a passageway for structures moving between the anterior thigh and posterior leg.

It transmits the femoral artery, femoral vein (posterior to the artery), nerve to the vastus medialis and the saphenous nerve – the largest cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve.

As the femoral artery and vein exit the canal, they are called the popliteal artery and vein respectively.
