They can be divided into three groups:

- Tarsals – a set of seven irregularly shaped bones. They are situated proximally in the foot in the ankle area.

- Metatarsals – connect the phalanges to the tarsals. There are five in number – one for each digit.

- Phalanges – the bones of the toes. Each toe has three phalanges – proximal, intermediate and distal (except the big toe, which only has two phalanges).

The foot can also be divided up into three regions:
 
1. **Hindfoot** – talus and calcaneus
2. **Midfoot** – navicular, cuboid and cuneiforms
3. **Forefoot** – metatarsals and phalanges.

The tarsal bones of the foot are organised into three rows; proximal, intermediate and distal.

## <mark>Proximal Group (Hindfoot)<mark>
The proximal tarsal bones are the talus and the calcaneus. These comprise the hindfoot, forming the bony framework around the proximal ankle and heel.

#### Talus

The talus is the most superior of the tarsal bones. It transmits the weight of the entire body to the foot. It has three articulations:

- Superiorly – ankle joint – between the talus and the bones of the leg (the tibia and fibula).

- Inferiorly – subtalar joint – between the talus and calcaneus.

- Anteriorly – talonavicular joint – between the talus and the navicular.

The main function of the talus is to transmit forces from the tibia to the heel bone (known as the calcaneus). It is wider anteriorly compared to posteriorly which provides additional stability to the ankle.

Whilst numerous ligaments attach to the talus, no muscles originate from or insert onto it. This means there is a high risk of avascular necrosis as the vascular supply is dependent on fascial structures.

#### Calcaneus

The calcaneus is the largest tarsal bone and lies underneath the talus where it constitutes the heel. It has two articulations:

- Superiorly –  subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint – between the calcaneus and the talus.

- Anteriorly – calcaneocuboid joint – between the calcaneus and the cuboid.

It protrudes posteriorly and takes the weight of the body as the heel hits the ground when walking. The posterior aspect of the calcaneus is marked by calcaneal tuberosity, to which the Achilles tendon attaches.

## <mark>Intermediate Group (Midfoot)<mark>
The intermediate row of tarsal bones contains one bone, the navicular (given its name because it is shaped like a boat).

Positioned medially, it articulates with the talus posteriorly, all three cuneiform bones anteriorly, and the cuboid bone laterally. On the plantar surface of the navicular, there is a tuberosity for the attachment of part of the tibialis posterior tendon.

<br>

## <mark>Distal Group (Midfoot)<mark>
In the distal row, there are four tarsal bones – the cuboid and the three cuneiforms. These bones articulate with the metatarsals of the foot

The cuboid is furthest lateral, lying anterior to the calcaneus and behind the fourth and fifth metatarsals. As its name suggests, it is cuboidal in shape. The inferior (plantar) surface of the cuboid is marked by a groove for the tendon of fibularis longus.

The three cuneiforms (lateral, intermediate (or middle) and medial) are wedge shaped bones. They articulate with the navicular posteriorly, and the metatarsals anteriorly. The shape of the bones helps form a transverse arch across the foot. They are also the attachment point for several muscles:

- Medial cuneiform – tibialis anterior, (part of) tibialis posterior and fibularis longus
- Lateral cuneiform – flexor hallucis brevis
