The muscles acting on the foot can be divided into two distinct groups; extrinsic and intrinsic muscles.

- The extrinsic muscles arise from the anterior, posterior and lateral compartments of the leg. They are mainly responsible for actions such as eversion, inversion, plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the foot.

- The intrinsic muscles are located within the foot and are responsible for the fine motor actions of the foot, for example movement of individual digits.
