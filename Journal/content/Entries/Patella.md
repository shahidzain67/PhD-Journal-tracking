The patella (knee-cap) is located at the front of the knee joint, within the patellofemoral groove of the femur. Its superior aspect is attached to the quadriceps tendon, and inferior aspect to the patellar ligament.

It is classified as a sesamoid type bone due to its position within the quadriceps tendon, and is the largest sesamoid bone in the body.

The patella has a triangular shape, with anterior and posterior surfaces. The apex of the patella is situated inferiorly, and is connected to the tibial tuberosity by the patella ligament. The base forms the superior aspect of the bone, and provides the attachment area for the quadriceps tendon.

The posterior surface of the patella articulates with the femur, and is marked by two facets:

- Medial facet – articulates with the medial condyle of the femur.
- Lateral facet – articulates with the lateral condyle of the femur.

The patella has two main functions:

- Leg extension – Enhances the leverage that the quadriceps tendon can exert on the femur, increasing the efficiency of the muscle.
- Protection – Protects the anterior aspect of the knee joint from physical trauma.
