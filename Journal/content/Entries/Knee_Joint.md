The knee joint is a hinge type synovial joint, which mainly allows for flexion and extension (and a small degree of medial and lateral rotation). It is formed by articulations between the patella, femur and tibia.

The knee joint consists of two articulations – tibiofemoral and patellofemoral. The joint surfaces are lined with hyaline cartilage, and are enclosed within a single joint cavity.

- Tibiofemoral – medial and lateral condyles of the femur articulate with the tibial condyles. It is the weight-bearing component of the knee joint.

- Patellofemoral – anterior aspect of the distal femur articulates with the patella. It allows the tendon of the quadriceps femoris (knee extensor) to be inserted directly over the knee – increasing the efficiency of the muscle.

As the patella is both formed and resides within the quadriceps femoris tendon, it provides a fulcrum to increase power of the knee extensor, and serves as a stabilising structure that reduces frictional forces placed on femoral condyles.

The blood supply to the knee joint is through the genicular anastomoses around the knee, which are supplied by the genicular branches of the femoral and popliteal arteries.

The nerve supply, according to Hilton’s law, is by the nerves which supply the muscles which cross the joint. These are the femoral, tibial and common fibular nerves.

<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Menisci </center></font>  
---

The medial and lateral menisci are fibrocartilage structures in the knee that serve two functions:

- To deepen  the articular surface of the tibia, thus increasing stability of the joint.

- To act as shock absorbers by increasing surface area to further dissipate forces.

They are C shaped, and attached at both ends to the intercondylar area of the tibia.

In addition to the intercondylar attachment, the medial meniscus is fixed to the tibial collateral ligament and the joint capsule. Damage to the tibial collateral ligament usually results in a medial meniscal tear.

The lateral meniscus is smaller and does not have any extra attachments, rendering it fairly mobile.

<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Bursae </center></font>  
---

A bursa is synovial fluid filled sac, found between moving structures in a joint – with the aim of reducing wear and tear on those structures. There are four bursae found in the knee joint.

- Suprapatella bursa – This is an extension of the synovial cavity of the knee, located between the quadriceps femoris and the femur.

- Prepatella bursa – Found between the apex of the patella and the skin.

- Infrapatella bursa – Split into deep and superficial. The deep bursa lies between the tibia and the patella ligament. The superficial lies between the patella ligament and the skin.

- Semimembranosus bursa – Located posteriorly in the knee joint, between the semimembranosus muscle and the medial head of the gastrocnemius.

<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Ligaments </center></font>  
---

The major ligaments in the knee joint are:

- Patellar ligament– a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon distal to the patella. It attaches to the tibial tuberosity.

- Collateral ligaments– two strap-like ligaments. They act to stabilise the hinge motion of the knee, preventing excessive medial or lateral movement
    - Tibial (medial) collateral ligament –  A wide and flat ligament, found on the medial side of the joint. Proximally, it attaches to the medial epicondyle of the femur, distally it attaches to the medial condyle of the tibia.

    - Fibular (lateral) collateral ligament –  Thinner and rounder than the tibial collateral, this attaches proximally to the lateral epicondyle of the femur, distally it attaches to a depression on the lateral surface of the fibular head.

- Cruciate Ligaments– These two ligaments connect the femur and the tibia. In doing so, they cross each other, hence the term ‘cruciate’ (Latin for like a cross)
    - Anterior cruciate ligament–  it attaches at the anterior intercondylar region of the tibia where it blends with the medial meniscus. It ascends posteriorly to attach to the femur in the intercondylar fossa. It prevents anterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur.

    - Posterior cruciate ligament– attaches at the posterior intercondylar region of the tibia, and ascends anteriorly to attach to the anteromedial femoral condyle. It prevents posterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur.

<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Movements </center></font>  
---

There are four main movements that the knee joint permits:

- Extension:  Produced by the quadriceps femoris, which inserts into the tibial tuberosity.

- Flexion: Produced by the hamstrings, gracilis, sartorius and popliteus.

- Lateral rotation: Produced by the biceps femoris.

- Medial rotation: Produced by five muscles; semimembranosus, semitendinosus, gracilis, sartorius and popliteus.

*Lateral and medial rotation can only occur when the knee is flexed (if the knee is not flexed, the medial/lateral rotation occurs at the hip joint).*
