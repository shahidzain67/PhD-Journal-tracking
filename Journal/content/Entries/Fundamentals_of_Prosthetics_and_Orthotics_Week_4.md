# <mark>Rocker-soled Shoe</mark>
- Designed to roll or rock a foot forward when walking
- Rocks/rolls forward during the stance phase of gait
- The thicker sole has to have a degree of rigidity to limit bending
- Can incorporate specific curves at different parts of the shoe
    - 2 curved rocker
    - 3 curved rocker
    - Radius from ankle centre, hip centre, knee centre

### Purpose
- They are used to change a specific biomechanical pattern during walking
    - Used to change the kinematic pattern, e.g:
        - limit movement of the 1st MTP joint
        - reduce ankle/knee range of motion

    - Used to change kinetic (moment pattern) and the ankle, knee or hip
        - Result in a change in the centre of pressure and/or direction of the ground reaction force vector

    - Used to change the pressure distribution under the foot (plantar pressure distribution)

    - Used to change muscle activation patterns


### Other possible effects (claimed by manufacturers):
- Decreased metabolic energy consumption
- Balance training
- Improving overall body posture
- Increasing muscle strength
- <mark> These have not been backed up by clinical assessments! <mark>

### Clinical Management:
- Used to manage a range of clinical conditions e.g:
    - Osteoarthritis of the foot
    - Intermittent claudication
    - Plantar fascilitis 

# <mark>Foot Ulceration in Diabetes</mark>
- Patients with diabetes are susceptible to:
    - Plantar ulcers (caused by increased pressure)
        - Pressures above 200 KPa can cause ulceration (Owings et al. (2009))

    - Heel ulcers (caused by increased pressure)

    - Dorsal ulcers (caused by poor fit)

    - Infection/bacterial growth (caused by increased humidity/temperature)

# <mark>Research Designs for Optimising Footwear Design</mark>
- Can consider 3 levels of research questions
    - Level 1: Questions to describe phenomena
        - theoretical or conceptual material but nothing known empirically
        - lead to descriptive designs, more complex research
    
    - Level 2: Questions which explore relationships
        - study relationships among phenomena which have already been studied at descriptive level
    
    - Level 3: Questions which test knowledge about cause-effect
        - contain predictive statements about what will happen to one variable on the basis of knowing another
        - manipulate 1 variable to understand the effect it has on another

- Operationalisation: reducing phenomena to a number in order to carry out statistical analysis
    - if the outcome is not chosen appropriately, the study has limited validity

**Example:**
- Level 1: Do patients use their footwear at home
- Level 2: Relationship between footwear use and x muscle strength
- Level 3: Effect of changing footwear on x muscle strength

- Rocker profile: number of parameters e.g. 
    - rocker angle for curved rocker shoe
    - apex position
    - rocker axis

- Repeated measures design:
    - all people exposed to different conditions
    - e.g. testing a number of different shoe designs
        - in-shoe pressure sensor used to measure plantar pressure to quantify data
        - calculate pressure curve for sensors at a given time
        - locate area of peak pressure

# <mark>Purpose of footwear for people with diabetes<mark>
- Elevated plantar pressure is a known risk factor for ulceration
- Footwear needs to be aesthetically pleasing as well as clinically effective

- Types of footwear for patients with diabetes
    - extra depth shoes
    - flexible shoes
    - traditional rocker shoes
    - curved rocker shoes

- Acceptability of footwear for patients
    - influenced by:
        - relative risk of adverse health outcome
        - previous experience with adverse health outcome

    - Prevention is better than treatment
        - better to target those who are at moderate risk with acceptable footwear choice
    
    - Manufacturing trade-off with outside geometry to create specific rocker

    - If we want to increase rocker angle, have to have a thicker outsole
        - thicker outsole = more effective
        - But less favourable to patients

**Curved Rocker shoe:**
- Four footwear features:
    - Rocker angle
    - Apex position
    - Apex angle
    - Sole stiffness

- Typical shoe:
    - apex angle of 55% of shoe length
    - rocker angle of 10 degrees
    - rocker axis aligned with metatarsal break

- Need a control study varying each of the design features to see effect on the foot
