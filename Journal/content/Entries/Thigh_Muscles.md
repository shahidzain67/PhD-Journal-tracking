<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> The Fascia Lata </center></font>
---

Fascia is a sheet or band of fibrous tissue lying deep to the skin. It lines, invests, and separates structures within the body. There are three main types of fascia:

- Superficial fascia – blends with the reticular layer beneath the dermis.
- Deep fascia – envelopes muscles, bones, and neurovascular structures.
- Visceral fascia – provides membranous investments that suspend organs within their cavities.

The fascia lata is a deep fascial investment of the musculature of the thigh, and is analogous to a strong, extensible, and elasticated stocking. It begins proximally around the iliac crest and inguinal ligament, and ends distal to the bony prominences of the tibia. It is continuous with what is renamed the deep fascia of the leg (also known as the crural fascia).

The depth of the fascia lata varies considerably across the thigh. It is thickest along the superolateral aspect of the thigh, where it arises from the fascial condensations of gluteus maximus and medius. It is also thick around the knee where the fascia receives reinforcing fibres from tendons of the quadriceps muscles. The fascial investment is thinnest where it covers the adductor muscles of the medial thigh.

The deepest aspect of the fascia lata gives rise to three intermuscular septa that attach centrally to the femur. The septa divide the thigh musculature into three compartments; anterior, medial, and lateral. The lateral intermuscular septum is the strongest of the three due to reinforcement from the iliotibial tract (see later), whereas the other two septa are proportionately weaker.

An ovoid hiatus known as the saphenous opening is present in the fascia lata just inferior to the inguinal ligament. The opening serves as an entry point for efferent lymphatic vessels and the great saphenous vein, draining into superficial inguinal lymph nodes and the femoral vein respectively.

| Iliotibial Tract (ITT) | Acts as an extensor, abductor and lateral rotator of the hip, with an additional role in providing lateral stabilisation to the knee joint. | TYhe deepest aspect of ITT extends centrally to form the lateral intermuscular septum of the thigh and attaches to the femur. | Forms a sheath around the tensor fascia lata muscle. |

<font size="+2" color="orange"><center> Tensor Fascia Lata (TFL) </center></font>

The tensor fascia lata is a gluteal muscle that acts as a flexor, abductor, and internal rotator of the hip. Its name, however, is derived from its additional role in tensing the fascia lata. It is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, like gluteus medius and minimus, but is located more anterolaterally than the other gluteal muscles.

The muscle originates from the iliac crest, and descends inferiorly to the superolateral thigh. At the junction of the middle and upper thirds of the thigh, it inserts into the anterior aspect of the iliotibial tract. When stimulated, the tensor fasciae lata tautens the iliotibial band and braces the knee, especially when the opposite foot is lifted.

The property of TFL tightening the fascia lata is analogous to hoisting an elastic stocking up the thigh. When the fascia lata is pulled taut, it forces muscles in the anterior and posterior compartments closer to towards the femur. Contraction within each compartment centralises muscle weight and limits outward expansion, which in turn reduces the overall force required for movement at the hip joint.

An additional property of tensing the fascia lata is that it makes muscle contraction more efficient in compressing deep veins, which ensures adequate venous return to the heart from the lower limbs.

<font size="+4" color="orange"><center> Attachments </center></font>

**Proximal** 
The fascia lata arises from multiple superior attachments around the pelvis and hip region:

- Posterior – sacrum and coccyx.
- Lateral – iliac crest.
- Anterior – inguinal ligament, superior pubic rami.
- Medial – inferior ischiopubic rami, ischial tuberosity, sacrotuberous ligament.

The fascia lata is also continuous with other regions of deep and superficial fascia at its superior aspect. The deep iliac fascia descends from the thoracic region at the diaphragm, covers the entire iliacus and psoas regions, and blends with the fascia lata superiorly.

The superficial fascia of the inferior abdominal wall (Scarpa’s fascia) and perineal region both blend with the fascia lata just below the inguinal ligament.

<br>

**Lateral**   
The lateral thickening of fascia lata forms the iliotibial tract and receives tendon insertions superiorly from gluteus maximus and tensor fascia lata. The widened band of fibres descends the lateral thigh and attaches to the lateral tibial condyle on the anterolateral (Gerdy) tubercle.
   
<br>

**Inferior**   
The fascia lata ends at the knee joint where it then becomes the deep fascia of the leg (the crural fascia). Attachments are made at bony prominences around the knee including the femoral and tibial condyles, patella, head of fibula and the tibial tuberosity.
   
<br>

**Central**   
The deep aspect of fascia lata produces three intermuscular septa which attach centrally to the femur. The lateral septum joins to the lateral lip of the linea aspera and the medial and anterior septa attach to the medial lip. These attachments then continue along the whole length of the femur to include the supracondylar lines.

The gluteal region is an anatomical area located posteriorly to the pelvic girdle, at the proximal end of the femur. The muscles in this region move the lower limb at the hip joint.

The muscles of the gluteal region can be broadly divided into two groups:

- Superficial abductors and extenders – group of large muscles that abduct and extend the femur. Includes the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and tensor fascia lata.

- Deep lateral rotators – group of smaller muscles that mainly act to laterally rotate the femur. Includes the quadratus femoris, piriformis, gemellus superior, gemellus inferior and obturator internus.

The arterial supply to these muscles is mostly via the superior and inferior gluteal arteries – branches of the internal iliac artery. Venous drainage follows the arterial supply.

<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Thigh Anterior Compartment Muscles </center></font>
---

The musculature of the thigh can be split into three sections; anterior, medial and posterior. Each compartment has a distinct innervation and function. The muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh are innervated by the femoral nerve (L2-L4), and as a general rule, act to extend the leg at the knee joint.

There are three major muscles in the anterior thigh – the pectineus, sartorius and quadriceps femoris. In addition to these, the end of the iliopsoas muscle passes into the anterior compartment.

---

The muscles in the posterior compartment of the thigh are collectively known as the hamstrings. They consist of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus, which form prominent tendons medially and laterally at the back of the knee.

As group, these muscles act to extend at the hip, and flex at the knee. They are innervated by the sciatic nerve (L4-S3).

---

The muscles in the medial compartment of the thigh are collectively known as the hip adductors. There are five muscles in this group; gracilis, obturator externus, adductor brevis, adductor longus and adductor magnus.

All the medial thigh muscles are innervated by the obturator nerve, which arises from the lumbar plexus. Arterial supply is via the obturator artery.
