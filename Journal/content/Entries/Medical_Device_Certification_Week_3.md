* Process is documented   

Met by:
* a quality system
* thorough product testing

Regulatory requirements:
* Europe - Medical Devices Regulation (CE Mark)

**15 Steps to Compliance for Medical Devices:**
* Determine it is a medical device
* Determine the scope of the device
* Determine the device certification
* Select a conformity assessment procedure
* Identify applicable "essential requirements"
* Product safety requirements - risk assessment
* Implement as ISO 13485 QMS
* Design Verification and Validation including 
  - Performance evaluation
  - Usability Engineering
  - Clinical Evaluation and Clinical Investigation

* Assemble "Technical documentation"
* Apply the conformity assessment procedure (notified body assessment needed?)
* Affix "CE MARK", Declaration of conformity, UDI and register with competent authority
* Appoint an authorised representative
* Review and update PMS and PMCF
* Plan for Unannounced Audits

**CE MARK**
* Understand and comply with the regulations
* Develop your device under a QMS and gain ISO 13485
* Develop your device in planned stages

**ISO Standards:**
* ISO means international
* Each country has slightly different ISO standards
* "Mandatory" and "Where Applicable" standards
* BSI Shop is a place to go to buy ISO standards

**MDDEVS's:**
* Guidance documents provided for companies where no ISO standards exists or as additional information

**Medical Device vs IVD:**
* Medical devices touch/analyse the human directly
* IVD analyses samples of human cells etc, something that comes out of the body
* The definitions in the CE Regulations very much determine what is an IVD or MD - intended purpose and context of use very important
* CE Regulations
  - MDR
  - IVDR

**What is a quality management system?**
* QMS is a set of written procedures for every process

---
 
Common words to describe the position of anatomical structures:

--- 
* **Anterior:** - To the front.

--- 
* **Posterior:** - To the back.

--- 
* **Superior:** - Above.

--- 
* **Inferior:** - Below.

--- 
* **Lateral:** - Away from the midline.

--- 
* **Medial:** - Towards the middle.

--- 
* **Proximal:** - Closer to the middle of the body.

--- 
* **Distal:** - Further away from the middle of the body.

--- 
* **Superficial:** - Closer to the surface of the body.

--- 
* **Deep:** - Further away from the surface of the body.

--- 
* **Fossa:** - a depression or hollow.

---  
* **Foramen:** - a hole.

--- 
* **Process:** - a thin prominence or protuberance.

--- 
* **Ramus:** - a thin process projecting from a bone.

--- 
* **Spine:** - a sharp process of a bone.

--- 
* **Sulcus:** - groove.

--- 
* **Trabecula:** - the thin bars of bony tissue in spongy bone.

---  
* **Lamella:** - thin bands of calcified bone matrix.

--- 
* **Trochlear:** - an anatomical part having the structure or function of a pulley.

--- 
* **Tuberosity:** - a large rounded protuberance on a bone / expanded / pulled out. 

--- 
* **Facet:** - plate like surface.

**Flexion:** - involves ‘the bending of two adjacent body segments so that their two anterior/posterior surfaces are brought together’
(Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).   

* Hip flexion   
* Knee flexion   
* Ankle flexion    
* Plantarflexion.

**Extension:** - involves ‘the moving apart of two opposing surfaces’ or ‘movement beyond the neutral position’ (Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).  

* Hip extension
* Knee extension
* Ankle extension
* Dorsiflexion.
