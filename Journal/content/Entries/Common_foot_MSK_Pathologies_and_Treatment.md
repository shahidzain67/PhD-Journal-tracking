- Plantar fasciitis is a condition in which there is
persistent pain associated with chronic
degenerative and reparative processes
affecting the origin of the plantar fascia and
surrounding peri-fascial surfaces. (NICE 2014).

- Accounts for 80% of heel pains. likely hood of
getting 10%(life time prevalance).

- Therefore, if not sure more than likely to be
plantar fasciitis

- Patients with chronic plantar fasciitis have a
thickened plantar fascia,(McMillan et al.2009)

- MR is good to highlight pathological change
4.5mm or thicker denotes plantar fasciitis.

<br>

<mark> **Plantar fascia rupture** <mark>

- Not common,more liable to occur with steroid
injection. Loss of medial arch profile. May be
partial/complete.

<mark>Function<mark>

- Change how and where forces are applied to the foot
    - Take the job of some of the structures in the foot that are commonly affected by pain
    - Can change the position and motion of the foot in walking and running (Nester et al, 2014)

<br>

- External forces applied to foot from:
    - Ground reaction force
        - Relates to surface, shoes, insole, hosiery

<br>

- Internal forces applied to foot from:
    - Muscle/tendons
    - Ligaments
    - Bone (joint contact forces)
   
<br>

- The orthosis will be designed to change the external force applied to the foot in order to reduce the stress
experienced by internal (painful) structures

- Stretching of plantar fascia is a common feature of treatment for plantar heel pain/ fasciitis (NICE 2014)

- Systematic review (Landorf 2015) identified 12 interventions for management of heel pain.
*weak, inconsistent evidence for stretching

- Sweeting (2011) stretching interventions varied
significantly between studies but combined
plantar fascia and calf stretched of benefit.

- Footwear difficulties for people with plantar
heel pain Sulivan (2015)

- Customised devices are more effective than
sham orthoses for improvement of function in
plantar heel pain. McCormick (2013)

first step pain, Bishop (2018)

- Customised foot orthoses may be equally
effective as prefabricated orthoses at reducing
pain or improving function in people with
plantar heel pain, Ring (2014).

- External forces are applied to the foot during weight bearing tasks – at varied sites and varied directions.

- Internal forces from the rest of the body are
applied to the foot

<br>

<mark>**Critical appraisal of foot orthotics**<mark>

- A number of criticisms have been made and difficulties encountered when researching the effects of foot orthoses. These are due to the variable nature of:

    - the patient profile,

    - individual orthotic prescription,

    - manufacture of the device, and

    - measurement of the outcome.

<br>

<mark>**Orthotics - Patient Perspective**<mark>

- Despite development of evidence that orthotics
have a therapeutic benefit there is still a lack of
robust scientific evidence to support the use
of foot orthoses.

- Despite the significant shortfall of evidence in
orthotic care both practitioners and patients
strongly defend the clinical benefits of
orthotic therapies in reducing pain associated
with a wide range of muscular skeletal
pathologies

<font size="+7" color="Orange"><center> Conclusion - Foot Orthotics </center></font>
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

- There is still insufficient numbers of good
quality RCT’S to evaluate the clinical
effectiveness of orthotics.

- Hence, systematic and critical review of the
provision and efficacy of foot orthoses remains
an essential goal within professional practise so
that practitioners can demonstrate a body of
evidence supports the clinical decision made. 

- Convential trends in the range of orthotics
provision in the health service are being
challenged due a range of factors including to
economic need, professional development and
time management.

- Service evaluations are required to assess the
clinical value of treatment interventions.
