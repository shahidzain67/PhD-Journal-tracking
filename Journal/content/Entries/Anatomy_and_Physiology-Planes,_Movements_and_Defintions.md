--- 
* **Anatomy:** - Branch of biological science that studies the structure of an organism.  

--- 
* **Physiology:** - The science of the functioning of living organisms and of their component parts.

--- 
* **Gross scale:** - Large scale systemic and regional.

--- 
* **Micro scale:** - Small scale structure.

--- 
* **Surface anatomy:** - The features we can see or palpate (examine by touch) on the outside of the body. Prominent anatomical structures that we can see / palpate are called anatomical landmarks.

--- 
* **Clinical anatomy:** - Relates to how anatomical structures change with pathology or range of motion (the amount of movement allowed at a joint).

--- 
* **Positional terminlogy:** - Describes the position of structures in space / in relation to each other.

---
* **Flexion:** - involves ‘the bending of two adjacent body segments so that their two anterior/posterior surfaces are brought together’
(Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).   

---
* **Extension:** - involves ‘the moving apart of two opposing surfaces’ or ‘movement beyond the neutral position’ (Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).  

--- 
* **Plantarflexion:** - ‘Moving the top (dorsum) of the foot away
from the anterior surface of the leg’.

--- 
* **Dorsiflexion:** - ‘Bringing the dorsum of the foot towards
the anterior surface of the leg’.

--- 
* **Eversion/Valgus:** - Posterior (back) of hindfoot moving away from midline.

--- 
* **Inversion/Varus:** - Posterior aspect of hindfoot moving closer towards the midline.

---
* **Abduction:** - ‘The movement of a body segment such that it moves away from the midline of the body’ (Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).

---
* **Adduction:** - ‘The movement of a body segment in a coronal plane such that it moves towards the midline of the body’ (Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).

---
* **Medial Rotation:** - ‘Rotation of a limb segment about its longitudinal axis so that the anterior surface comes to face the midline of the body’ (Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).

---
* **Lateral rotation:** - ‘Rotation of a limb segment about its longitudinal axis so that the anterior surface faces away from the midline’ (Palastanga & Soames, 2012, p3).

<font size="+4" color="gree"><center> Movements of the Foot </center></font>


* **Dorsiflexion (Extension):** - ‘Bringing the dorsum of the foot towards the anterior surface of the leg’.

* **Plantarflexion (Flexion):** - ‘Moving the top (dorsum) of the foot away from the anterior surface of the leg’.

* **Pronation:**: - Pronation of the foot is turning of the sole outwards, so that weight is borne on the medial part of the foot.

* **Supination:** - Supination of the foot is turning of the sole of the foot inwards, shifting weight to the lateral edge.

{{<figure src="/2019-10-03/Sup_Pro.png" class="post-cover">}} 

* **Eversion:** - Tilting the foot away from the midline of the body.

* **Inversion:** - Tilting the foot towards the midline of the body.
