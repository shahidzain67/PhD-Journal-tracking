It is critically important to consider how cardioprotection is achieved in heart diseases because mortality and morbidity of heart diseases have increased all over the world, and the burden from the viewpoint of not only the individual patient but also social and economical aspects is increased as we begin the 21st century. 

To decrease this burden, it is essential to protect the heart against ischemic stress, and there are three different aspects to achieve cardioprotection in ischemic hearts.

<br>

### <mark>1) Acquisition of Cardioprotection before the occurrence of Ischemia<mark>
- First, acquiring tolerance against ischemia and reperfusion injury before the onset of ischemia is effective for patients with coronary artery disease or coronary risk factors. 

- For example, development of collateral circulation in advance can reduce the severity of ischemia when coronary occlusion occurs. 

- Preventing rupture of the atheroma is another paradigm used to attenuate the incidence of acute coronary syndrome. 

- Furthermore, if the trigger mechanisms of cardioprotection due to ischemic preconditioning are elucidated, they can be applied in high-risk patients before acute myocardial infarction.

<br>

### <mark>2) Develop the tool for the treatment of ischemic and reperfusion injury<mark>
- Second, it is also important to develop the tool for the treatment of ischemic and reperfusion injury. 

- To our knowledge, we still do not have the drugs or tools to decrease either infarct size or cardiac remodeling in patients with acute myocardial infarction, except for recanalization therapy. 

- Even when patients survive acute myocardial infarction, chronic ischemic heart failure may occur

<br>

### <mark>3) Obtain drugs to treat chronic ischemic heart failure.<mark>
- Therefore, as the third paradigm, we need to obtain drugs to treat chronic ischemic heart failure. 

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers have been proven to attenuate the mortality and morbidity of chronic heart failure; how ever, we do not believe that these drugs are powerful enough to treat chronic heart failure with full satisfaction.

> When the effective pretreatment to attenuate the ischemic injury is applied prior to the occurrence of ischemic heart disease in subjects with high-risk factors for acute myocardial infarction, such as hyperlipidemia, smoking, and hypertension, the pretreatment before the onset of myocardial ischemia will become an effective method for the attenuation of ischemia and reperfusion injury. 

Ischemia is a condition in which the blood flow (and thus oxygen) is restricted or reduced in a part of the body. Cardiac ischemia is the name for decreased blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle.

Ischemic heart disease is the term given to heart problems caused by narrowed heart arteries. When arteries are narrowed, less blood and oxygen reaches the heart muscle. This is also called coronary artery disease and coronary heart disease.

> This is similar to the immunization therapy for infectious diseases such as mumps.

<font size="+3" color="Blue"><center> A: Plaque Rupture </center></font>  
---

- Since it is well recognized that acute myocardial infarction occurs due to the abrupt plaque rupture followed by the accumulated platelet aggregation, it is critically important to prevent plaque rupture in patients with coronary artery disease. 

- One possibility is to apply cholesterol-lowering therapy. 

- Although pravastatin, one of the inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is reported to decrease stenotic coronary artery only to a modest extent, it decreases the incidence of cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease or in high-risk patients (1). 

- It is suggested that pravastatin stabilizes the plaques and prevents the rupture of plaques. 

- Pravastatin or simvastatin may decrease the content of cholesterol and the accumulation of macrophages at the stenotic site of the coronary artery and reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory actions. 

- Casscells et al. (2) reported that active plaques produce heat, suggesting that inflammatory reactions are involved in active plaques, which may make the fibrous cap fragile. 

- This inflammation may be caused by bacteria such as chlamydia or by lipid metabolites which activate monocytes. 

- Because probucol, an antioxidant drug with a moderate cholesterol-lowering capability, is very effective in decreasing the mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease, oxidative stress may be an important factor for the onset of plaque rupture. 

- Therefore, oxidative stress at the atheroma attacks fibrous caps, although there is no direct evidence or report of the methods to prevent plaque rupture at present.

<font size="+3" color="Blue"><center> B. Collateral Circulation </center></font>  
---

- Development of a collateral circulation from nonischemic myocardium to ischemic myocardium is an important strategy in attenuating the severity of myocardial ischemia when coronary arterial occlusion occurs. 

- The fibroblast growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) families are known to be important growth factors for angiogenesis (3–5). 

- Basic FGF has been proved to be responsible for the development of collateral circulation (6). 

- Yanagisawa et al.(6) showed clearly that basic FGF levels increase after the onset of myocardial infarction, suggesting that basic FGF may play a role in angiogenesis of collateral circulation in patients with coronary artery disease. 

- However, heparin is also known to cause angiogenesis because heparin activates HB-EGF, which induces the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (7, 8). 

- Furthermore, VEGF is also known to cause potent angiogenesis due to the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (9). 

- Interestingly, adenosine is shown to increase mRNA and the protein levels of VEGF (10), suggesting an important role for the development of collateral circulation. 

- Furthermore, adenosine increases the proliferation and migration of endothelial cellsin vitro (11). 

- However, in the in vivo condition, adenosine stimulates angiogenesis on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (Fig. 1) (12), and dipyridamole increases adenosine-induced angiogenesis. 

- Finally, repeated administration of dipyridamole in vivo for several weeks increases the regional myocardial flow of the ischemic area compared with the control, and this effect cannot be mimicked by diltiazem (13). 

- This result suggests that coronary vasodilation per se does not affect the development of collateral circulation, but the enhancement of adenosine during the administration of dipyridamole can increase the development of collateral vessels. 

- Taken together, either or all of the growth factors, such as VEGF, HB-EGF, and basic FGF, may induce angiogenesis in patients with coronary artery disease, which may constitute cardioprotection against ischemia and reperfusion injury. 

- Furthermore, pharmacological interventions, such as heparin or adenosine administration, may enhance angiogenesis via the induction of growth factors. 

- Gene transfection may lead to the development of collateral circulation (5, 14). 

- Indeed, Losordo et al. (5) initiated a phase 1 clinical study to determine the safety and bioactivity of direct myocardial gene transfer of VEGF as the sole therapy for patients with symptomatic myocardial ischemia. 

- In five patients who had failed conventional therapy for angina, naked plasmid DNA encoding VEGF (phVEGF165) was injected directly into the ischemic myocardium. 

- They found that all of the patients had a significant reduction in angina and that the postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was either unchanged or improved. 

- Objective evidence of reduced ischemia was documented using dobutamine single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in all patients. 

- Coronary angiography showed an improved Rentrop score in all of the five patients. 

- Therefore, gene transfection to increase collateral circulation may become one of the potential treatments of coronary artery disease. 

- Another method used to increase ischemic tolerance is to induce cardioprotection prior to the ischemia of acute myocardial infarction, and one potential way is to induce in advance the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning in patients with coronary artery disease.

Ischemic preconditioning has received much attention from both basic researchers and clinicians. This was first described by the research group of Murry et al. (15). 

- Results to date have shown that ischemic preconditioning limits infarct size to 10–20% of the risk area in the reperfused ischemic myocardium (16–19). 

- Liu et al. (16) have implicated endogenous adenosine as a trigger or mediator in ischemic preconditioning by demonstrating that the administration of 8-(sulphophenyl)theophylline abolishes the salutary effect of ischemic preconditioning. 

- These investigators have hypothesized that ischemic preconditioning occurs via adenosine A1 receptor activation. 

- Adenosine A1 receptor activation activates protein kinase C (PKC) via the activation of phospholipase C, and several investigators, including the authors, found that the activation of PKC is transiently observed after the procedure of ischemic preconditioning (18, 19). 

- Furthermore, the inhibition of PKC blunts the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning (17–20). 

- Therefore, at present, activation of protein kinase C is believed to be a common pathway in triggering cardioprotection.

- The next question is how protein kinase C activation triggers the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning. 

- Activation of protein kinase C opens KATP channels, and the opening of KATP channels may be cardioprotective against ischemia and reperfusion injury. 

- The opening of mitochondrial KATP channels is also activated via protein kinase C (20, 21), suggesting that it is mitochondrial KATP channels which are responsible for cardioprotection. 

- It was shown that the activation of PKC increases ecto-5β-nucleotidase activity (Fig. 2) and mediates the cardioprotection via the enhancement of adenosine production in ischemic preconditioning (17, 18). 

- Cardioprotection due to the ischemic preconditioning procedure disappears in several hours, and this disappearance could be attributable to dephosphorylation of the cardioprotective proteins or enzymes. 

- Interestingly, cardioprotection will reappear in 24–48 hr after the ischemic preconditioning. 

- This is known as the second window of ischemic preconditioning (22, 23). 

- Marbe et al. (22) reported that HSP72 induction is important in mediating the infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning, and Kuzuya et al. (23) reported that Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) induction may contribute to the cardioprotection in ischemic preconditioning.
