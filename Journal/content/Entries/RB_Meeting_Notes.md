# Project Notes

- Scholl focuses on:
    - Hard, dry, cracked skin
    - Aching and swollen feet/legs
    - Feet comfort in shoe and mobility

- Most Scholl consumers are female
    - Will this impact the modular system we are adopting for the foot simulator project

- Potentially more business impacts to think about in terms of project proposal
    - Impact on dimensions on products -> bigger = more expensive
    - De-risking projects, sticking to tight deadlines are the most important factors

- Pace of the business vs Pace of the research
    - How much will it actually save in projects through disruption of the 'normal' development route
    - Potentially will be offered financial value of the project - <mark>To be discussed</mark>

# To do

<mark> Much more of an emphasis on the synthetic foot, not the loading mechanism (ground). </mark>

Checkout how the actuation of the leg/foot would happen - existing tech, maybe how they test prosthetic legs, cadaveric simulations?

# General Notes

- Most innovation in Europe, Japan, Australia
    - Some competition in US with existing brands

- RB's main targets = consumer health
    - Not many/none products to be prescribed
    - Products designed to be purchased and self-used

- Some old products that haven't been developed for years but are still sold
    - Prosport - knee supports, bandages etc
    - Cough Sweets
    - Shoe Polish

- Scholl manufactures most products externally
    - Some links to other RB Brands e.g. creams manufactured with E45

- Manufacturing centres worldwide
    - Dongguan - device development
    - Potentially worthwhile going to manufacturing centres to see process
        - All labs etc based in Hull
    

- RB tend to use clinical studies to prove a fairly strong hypothesis
    - Hypothesis -> clinical study to prove -> final idea
