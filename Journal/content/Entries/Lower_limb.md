### <mark>Advantages and Disadvantages of Disarticulations<mark>

Disarticulations – e.g. hip, knee, ankle

- distal (end) bearing
- less need for weight distribution
- less need for intrusive proximal socket extension
- self-suspending
- potentially greater range of motion
- potentially less space for distal components
- potentially segment length difference compared to sound side

- Lengths - ruler (in 3 directions)
- CoM - knife edge
- RoG - pendulum

<br>

**<mark>Anatomic foot & shank (for trans-tibials)<mark>**
- Subtract prosthesis mass (incl. water bag) from body mass (incl.
prosthesis)
    - to obtain body mass as if amputated through knee

<br>

- From anthropometric data, calculate body mass if not amputated
    - to obtain more accurate anatomic segment mass

<font size="+7" color="turquoise"><center> What is a prosthesis? </center></font>  
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

A prosthesis is a device that replaces a part of a body that was either absent from birth or has been lost due to injury, illness and / or deformity

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

- 1912 when an aluminium prosthetic leg was created by Marcel and Charles Desoutter after Marcel lost a leg in an aviation accident. The aluminium leg weight about 1.8 kg instead of the usual 3.5 to 4.5 kg at the time.

- Lots of materials and techniques borrowed from the aviation industry.

- 1969 – Otto Bock invents the first modular prosthetic system, facilitating ease of changing components and alignment of the prosthesis

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

**Exoskeletal.**

Most of these were still common in the UK in the late 1980’s

{{<figure src="/Lower_limb/exo.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

---

<br><br>

</details>

<font size="+7" color="turquoise"><center> Modular Systems</center></font>  
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

**Endoskeletal**

- Add/change components that give you available features for each joint being replaced

- Adjustable – easier to change socket, length and alignment

- Easier to make and repair if parts are available

---

<br><br>

</details>

<font size="+7" color="turquoise"><center> Key Considerations</center></font>  
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

- The ‘Fit’ (the prosthetic interface with the residual limb)

- The Function-how useful it is

- Biomechanics is central to comfort and function

- The Cosmesis-its appearance

---

<br><br>

</details>

<font size="+7" color="turquoise"><center> The Residuum</center></font>  
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

- The residual limb has been described as an outer envelope of the skin and soft tissue surrounding a central strut, the skeletal shaft.

- The soft tissue which covers the residuum is not designed for weightbearing

- Trans-tibial has no horizontal weightbearing surface.

- The qualities of the skin coverage and the amount and consistency of soft tissues is variable.

- The difficulties with fluctuation

- Differing amputation techniques – the quality of the residuum has a huge impact on rehabilitation!

---

<br><br>

</details>

<font size="+7" color="turquoise"><center>Weightbearing, Stability & Suspension</center></font>  
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

- The socket has to stabilize bone structure in all planes of motion through soft tissue in a manner which is comfortable and causes no damage or detriment to the soft tissue.

- The socket has to act as a mechanical junction or coupling between the soft tissue and skeleton of the residual limb and the rigid structure of the prosthesis during non-weight-bearing situations. The aim is to have minimum longitudinal displacement between weight bearing and non-weight bearing phases.

<br>

### <mark>Weightbearing<mark>

{{<figure src="/Lower_limb/weight1.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

<br>

{{<figure src="/Lower_limb/weight1.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

<br>

### <mark>Stability<mark>

If the bone structure is not stable then the socket will be able to move causing instability and there will be lessened control at joints 

<br>

### <mark>Suspension<mark>

- Mechanical – Utilisation of a bony structure that they hook over such as the femoral condyles or iliac crests or radial compression and coefficient of friction

- Suction – The creation of a situation where negative pressure creates a vacuum – Active vacuum

<br>

### <mark>A Good Socket<mark>

- “A Good fit is not Primarily defined by a particular shape of socket, but by the accommodation of the forces or pressures between the stump and socket to provide for comfortable and harmless weight-bearing, stabilisation and suspension.” Klasson B 1995

- Cosmetics & Range of movement.

- Revisiting theories/techniques as materials and technology changes

> Redheads, R., (1979) - total surface bearing socket really came into play with ICEROSS and other liners

<br>

### <mark>Names of Socket Types<mark>

**Trans-femoral**

- Quadrilateral
- ‘H’ for health
- ‘C’ for conventional
- Ischial containment sockets
- Marlo Anatomical socket
- Hifi
- Hybrid
- Ossur trans-femoral Socket
- Sub ischial sockets

<br>

**Trans-tibial**

- Patella tendon bearing
- Patella tendon bearing with
- supracondylar
- Patella tendon bearing with supracondylar and supra patella
- Total surface bearing

<br>

### <mark>Evidence for which is the Best Socket?<mark>

-  Not enough and often small scale (extraneous variables)

-  Still many issues

-  ICS more comfortable than quadrilaterals (Hachisuka et al, 1999)

-  Or perhaps not (Boonstra et al.,1994)

-  MAS sockets have also been reported to improve gait efficiency, ease ascending slopes and sitting in soft chairs (Traballesi, et al, 2011) and provide greater ischial containment and medio-lateral stability than other sockets and that it also reduces trim lines which improves hip range of motion, (Trower, 2006; Perry, 1992; Flandry et al, 1989; Klotz, 2011).

-  Limited Hip flexion Hagberg (2005) 

<br>

### <mark>Osseo-integration<mark>

- No need for a socket
- Improved control of prosthesis
- Improved range of motion
- Increased sensation of external world.
- Risk of infection
- Still need to consider alignment
- Needs of surgery
- Need for the removal of the abutment
- Need for quality bone to implant into

{{<figure src="/Lower_limb/osseo.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

<br>

### <mark>Alignment<mark>

- The relationship between the socket and the remaining elements of the prosthesis is key

- The relationship between each joint in the lower limb is also key

- Symmetry is often (but not always) sought

- Primary (new) patients will often need a number of re-adjustments, to both socket and prosthetic componentry

- These factors will influence prescription
