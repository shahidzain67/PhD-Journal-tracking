<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Defintions </center></font>  

- “Process of systematically locating, appraising and synthesising evidence from scientific studies in order to obtain a reliable overview” - Helen Worthington

- “Systematic reviews aim to identify, evaluate and summarise the findings of all relevant individual studies, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to decision makers.” - CRD (2009) p.V

- “A systematic review can be defined as “a review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyze data from the studies that are included in the review. Statistical methods (meta-analysis) may or may not be  used to analyze and summarize the results of the included studies.” - http://www.cochrane.org/glossary

<br><br>

---
<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Why might a review be needed? </center></font>  

- Is there a need to summarise existing information using an unbiased method?

- Are more general conclusions possible to be drawn from a SR over multiple single studies?

- Is evidence needed to inform a research project or answer previous unanswered questions in a topic area?

<br><br>

---
<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Points to Consider Beforehand </center></font> 

- Why is this question being asked?

- Do we already know the answer e.g. what other evidence is there related to this?

- Is a review the best method?

- Does the research question now need to be refined?

<br><br>

---
<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Narrative Review vs Systematic Review </center></font> 

- <mark>Narrative Review<mark>

    - Often more broad, less or undefined method of searching, critiquing and synthesising data (unlikely have meta analysis)

- <mark>Systematic Review<mark>

    - Focused research question, rigorous method, searching, appraising, critiquing and then synthesising data (qual and quant)

<br><br>

---
<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Pros and Cons </center></font> 

- <mark>Advantages<mark>
    - Reduces Bias
    - Replicable
    - Can provide understanding of conflicting findings across studies
    - Helps inform decision making
    - Can combine data from studies to perform a meta-analysis to determine effect of interventions
  

- <mark>Disadvantages<mark>
    - Can still lead to inconclusive results and recommendations for more evidence
    - May have an empty or very limited review
    - Study quality may be poor
    - Can take a long time for evidence to impact practice/policy

<font size="+7" color="orange"><center> Protocol Development </center></font> 

<font size="+3" color="gree"><center> Check! </center></font> 

- Has the review or a similar review already been conducted?
    - If so when/where – is it in need of updating/different location?

- Has it been conducted using one method but there is scope to use a different one (e.g. qual/quant or review of reviews)

- Are there likely to be studies in the review

- Has the title or a similar study been registered as a protocol (e.g. on PROSPRO)

<br>
<font size="+3" color="gree"><center> Why Develop a Protocol? </center></font> 

- Provides a framework – ensure transparency and reproducibility 

- Reduces bias

- Provides a brief background and rationale for the review

- Describes how papers will be identified, selected and evaluated

- Sets out the objectives

- Sets out the selection criteria

    - What types of studies and why?
    - Types of participants and rationale
    - If relevant types of interventions and comparisons –> what criteria must they meet (e.g. setting, time, who deliver)
    - Types of outcomes measures
    - Describe how studies will be identified, selected and evaluated

<br>
<font size="+3" color="gree"><center> Planning Considerations </center></font> 

- What is the title of your review? 
    - should be a statement not a question

- Who are the participants/target audience your interested in and why? 
    - (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, pre existing conditions)

- Intervention/programme characteristics of importance?

- Comparisons interested in? (e.g. intervention vs. control)

- Outcomes likely to be used within papers and interested in?

- Any studies you know of that would fit in the review?

<br>
<font size="+3" color="gree"><center> Protocols should consist: </center></font> 

- Background and rationale for the study

- Research questions/objectives

- Search strategy 
    - key words, data bases with years, any scoping

- Study selection 
    - inclusion & exclusion, how criteria will be applied how ensure bias is kept to a minimum

- Study quality 
    - how will this be checked and why that tool

- Data extraction  
    - how will the details needed to answer research objectives be taken from studies

- How synthesis planned 
    - any expected analysis and type of analysis (qual or quant or meta analysis), any sub groups interested in

- What and who you are aiming to contribute to through conducting the review

- A provisional timeline

- <mark> [CRD guide to a review protocol](http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/pdf/Systematic_Reviews.pdf) <mark>

<br>
<font size="+3" color="gree"><center> Formulating the review questions </center></font>

- Should relate to specific patient/topic problem

- Likely to be linked to an intervention, aetiology, diagnosis or prognosis 

- E.g To estimate the accuracy of … or To determine the effectiveness of …

- May be helpful to use the PICOC acronym
    - Population
    - Intervention
    - Comparison
    - Outcome/evaluative measures
    - Context/setting

- Other acronyms include:
    - PEO, SPICE, SPIDER, PICo, PEO

    - <mark>[libguides library](https://libguides.library.curtin.edu.au/c.php?g=202453&p=1587487)<mark>

- Is it a broad or narrow question?

    - Broad questions:
        - e.g. Do behaviour change interventions work in reducing back pain in office workers?

    - Narrow questions:
        - Is CBT effective in treating moderate depression in females aged 30-40 years old?

<br>
<font size="+3" color="gree"><center> Steps of Review Process </center></font>

1. Formulate question
2. Develop search strategy
3. Conduct comprehensive search
4. Title and abstract screening - using predesigned questions
5. Full text screening of possible included papers and unclear papers
6. Final set of papers obtained
7. Quality assessment of papers and data extraction
8. Synthesis of data
