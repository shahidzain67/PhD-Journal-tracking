The femoral canal is an anatomical compartment located in the anterior thigh. It is the smallest and most medial part of the femoral sheath. It is approximately 1.3cm long.

The femoral canal is located in the anterior thigh within the femoral triangle.

It can be thought of as a rectangular shaped compartment with four borders and an opening:

- Medial border – lacunar ligament.

- Lateral border – femoral vein.

- Anterior border – inguinal ligament.

- Posterior border – pectineal ligament, superior ramus of the pubic bone, and the pectineus muscle

The opening to the femoral canal is located at its superior border, known as the femoral ring. The femoral ring is closed by a connective tissue layer – the femoral septum. This septum is pierced by the lymphatic vessels exiting the canal.

The femoral canal contains:

- Lymphatic vessels – draining the deep inguinal lymph nodes.

- Deep lymph node – the lacunar node.

- Empty space.

- Loose connective tissue.

The empty space allows distension of the adjacent femoral vein, so it can cope with increased venous return, or increased intra-abdominal pressure.
