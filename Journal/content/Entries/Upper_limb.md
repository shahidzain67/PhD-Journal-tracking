David W. Dorrance, the original designer of the "Split Hook," in 1912 (US Patent 1042413). 

- Dorrance, lost his hand in 1909 in a sawmill accident, was unhappy with the immovable single "pirate’s hook," 
- He developed the split hook which allowed items to be squeezed and held in conjunction with a harness and straps

**The socket, or prosthetic interface:**

- Replacement joints, e.g. wrist, elbow 
- Connecting elements
- Terminal devices, including hands
- Suspension systems, such as harnesses 
- Control systems, such as myoelectric control

### <mark>The Socket-Shape Capture, and Fit<mark>

- Shape capture to create the correctly fitting socket usually begins with a plaster of Paris cast, that is rectified and used as a model to manufacture a prosthetic socket 

- Sockets are often contoured around existing bony anatomy, and can thereby suspend the prosthesis without any other form of external suspension system

- Sometimes however this isn’t possible, or desired

### <mark>Roll-on sockets<mark>

- ICElandic Roll On Silicone Socket (ICEROSS)

- Employs **‘quasi hydrostatic’** suspension mechanism

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

The natural upper limb is a complex tool, that is used to perform a wide variety of functions 

From activities of daily living, to communication, social use and cultural applications, the natural hand and the arm has a wise range of functional and other applications which makes it very difficult to replicate

<br>

### <mark>Types of Modern Prostheses<mark>

- Cosmetic prostheses
- Body powered prostheses
- Myoelectric prostheses

<br>

<font size="+3" color="orange"><center> Cosmetic Prostheses </center></font>

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

Designed to replicate the cosmetic size, shape and appearance of the missing limb, these can also act as basic holding or securing tools

They are the most commonly prescribed upper limb prostheses

Uses a biomechanical harness: either a:

- Full appendage - used to suspend and operate the terminal device in conjunction with a ‘cup’ socket, or a:

- Simpler harness such as a P-loop (transradial only), which will only be used to operate the terminal device and will be used with a self suspending socket

- Advantages: Good feedback, good control

- Disadvantages: Poor cosmesis, dated design, comfort of harness

{{<figure src="/Upper_limb/biomechanical.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

<br>

May be either active (with prehension) or passive (no prehension) 

- Passive e.g. foam hands, knife appliance
- Active e.g. split hooks
- May be interchangeable when used in conjunction with single knob wrist rotary

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

{{<figure src="/Upper_limb/myo.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

Advantages over body powered devices:

- More powerful, greater grip strength and opening
- No need for harness for control
- Can potentially use limb in more positions around the body
- High-tec appeal
- Open to improvements in technology

<br>

Disadvantages: 

- Heavy, costly, not as durable, harder to control, usually slower, less proprioception (feedback)

<br>

### <mark>Myoelectric Signals<mark>

- Created when muscles contract, these provide means of operating electrically powered prostheses

- They are picked up and amplified via electrodes located within the inner wall of the socket

<br>

### <mark>Myoelectric Control System<mark>

{{<figure src="/Upper_limb/control.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

<br>

### <mark>Types of Myoelectric Control<mark>

- **Threshold:** 15 microvolts at skin’s surface; any signal above this = same response from hand

- **Proportional:** 15 microvolts required for action again, but stronger signal=equivalent proportional response from the hand or component

- **Site/State:**  no. of  electrodes used= no. of sites
no. of functions  = no. of states

- Most hands are single degree of freedom hands, offering one grip type only

<br>

### <mark>Multi-Functional Hands<mark>

{{<figure src="/Upper_limb/bebionic.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="BeBionic Hand" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: white;" >}}

- 14 grip patterns
- passive wrist options including low profile
- Full hand grip, individual motors in each finger and thumb

<br>

{{<figure src="/Upper_limb/Mich.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Michelangelo Hand" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: white;" >}}

- 7 grip patterns
- Independently controlled thumb option
- Thumb, forefinger and middle finger grip
- Axon electric wrist option

  <summary> </summary>

- Socket-related movement artefacts
- Size and clarity of signal
- Number of available control ‘modes’

<br>

<font size="+3" color="orange"><center>Socket related movement artefacts: common mode voltage and its effects</center></font>  
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

- The human body acts like a giant antenna, and attracts electricity from sources such as overhead power cables, the mains supply and electrical appliances

- As a result, it constantly carries a ‘common mode voltage’ many times larger than a myoelectric signal

- If the electrode is displaced in relation to the skin’s surface, then a movement artefact, very similar in size and strength to the myoelectric signal, will be produced

<br>

### <mark>Filtering the signal<mark>

- The common mode voltage is filtered using a differential amplifier.

- As the contracting signal is discharged along the length of the muscle, the difference at each myode is registered as a positive and a negative signal and the difference is amplified

- If the electrode moves or lifts, the common mode voltage may become active, or a small electrical signal may be caused by the electrode and the skin acting as charged capacitors

<br><br>

</details>

<font size="+3" color="orange"><center>Size and Clarity of the Signal: Cross-Talk</center></font>  
---

<details>
  <summary> </summary>

- Cross talk occurs when a muscle other than the target muscle affects the signal acquisition

- Often occurs in congenital cases, where standard muscle boundaries are less well defined

{{<figure src="/Upper_limb/crosstalk.jpg" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;">}}

<br>

### <mark>Subcutaneous Fat & Surface Impedance<mark>

- Subcutaneous fat will increase the chance of cross talk and dissipate the signal, reducing its strength at the surface

- Surface impedance caused by skin particles, hairs and other barriers will also affect signal size and clarity

### <mark>Potential Solutions: Adjustable Electrode Housing, with De-coupling from the Socket<mark>

Use of an adjustable housing with de-coupling has produced an 83% reduction in signal production above prosthesis ‘activation’ thresholds during simple arm movements

  <summary> </summary>

- Despite recent advances, we still have along way to go to improve upper limb prostheses, and particularly myoelectric control

- Some options, such as simpler body-powered devices, would be of more benefit, particularly in developing countries and for sports and other activities

- There are a number of factors that contribute to the prescription of the most suitable device, but these can be best reached with a sound understanding of each patients wishes, and requirements
